Explanation of test cases are as follows to test for increasing k gives a lower accuracy:

Case 1 : Elimination Based on Different Past Action

Hypothesis:
	All correct cases will be eliminated based on action that cases the agent to go to either A or B. 
	When TB goes back until split actions not the same as problem run will give similarity of 0 and 
	thus get eliminated from candidate run list.

|B<-   ->A|

 --- ^ ---
|Y-> | <-X|
 ---------
 
 X = The starting location of the correct runs
 Y = The starting location of the incorrect run and the problem run
 
 A = The ending location of the correct runs
 B = The ending location of the incorrect run
 
 Agents will move from X/Y to A/B
 4 Runs -> 9 Steps
 	- Run 1 - 3 correct runs 
 	- Run 4 incorrect run
